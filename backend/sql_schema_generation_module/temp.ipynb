Within the data science field, there are two types of data \\nprocessing systems: online analytical processing (OLAP) and online transaction \\nprocessing (OLTP). The main difference is that one uses data to gain valuable \\ninsights, while the other is purely operational. However, there are meaningful ways \\nto use both systems to solve data problems. OLAP is a system for performing multi-\\ndimensional analysis at high speeds on large volumes of data. Typically, this data \\nis from a data warehouse, data mart or some other centralized data store. OLAP is \\nideal for data mining, business intelligence and complex analytical calculations, \\nas well as business reporting functions like financial analysis, budgeting and sales \\nforecasting.\\nIn this unit we will focus on Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).\\n  \\n5.1 OBJECTIVES\\nAfter going through this unit, you should be able to:\\n y understand the purpose of a OLAP; \\n y describe the motivation and benefits of OLAP;\\n y discuss Multidimensional Modeling;\\n y describe various OLAP operations;'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2023-08-03T16:08:03+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-03T16:08:53+05:30', 'source': 'data.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='72\\nEtl , O l AP and t rends\\n y list multi cube Applications and steps to create OLAP server, and\\n y discuss between various types of OLAP like MOLAP, ROLAP, DOLAP \\nand HOLAP.\\n5.2 OLAP AND ITS NEED\\nOnline Analytical Processing (OLAP) is the technology to analyze and process data \\nfrom multiple sources at the same time. It accesses the multiple databases at the \\nsame time. It is a software which helps the data analysts to collect data from different \\nperspective for developing effective business strategies. The query operations like \\ngroup, join or aggregation can be easily done with OLAP using pre-calculated or \\npre-aggregated data hence making it much faster than simple relational databases. \\nYou can understand OLAP as a multi cubic structure, which has many cubes, each \\ncube is pertaining to some database. The cubes are designed in such a way that \\ngenerates reports effectively and efficiently. \\nOLAP is the core component of the data warehouse implementation, providing \\nfast and flexible multi-dimensional data analysis for business intelligence (BI) and \\ndecision support applications. OLAP (for online analytical processing) is a software \\nused to perform high-speed, multivariate analysis of large amounts of data in data \\nwarehouses, data markets, or other unified and centralized data warehouses. The \\ndata is broken down for display, monitoring or analysis. For example, sales figures \\ncan be related to location (region, country, state/province, company), time (year, \\nmonth, week, day), product (clothing, male/female/child, brand, type), etc., but In \\na data warehouse, records are stored in tables, and each table can only sort data on \\ntwo of the dimensions at a time. Recording and reorganizing them into a multi-\\ndimensional format allows very fast processing and very in-depth analysis\\nThe primary objective of OLAP or data analysis is not just data processing .For \\ninstance, If a company might compare their sales in the month of January with the \\nmonth of February then compare those results with another location which may be \\nstored in a separate database. In this case, it needs a multi-view of database design \\nstoring all the data categories. Another example of Amazon, it analyzes purchases \\nmade by its customers to recommend the customers with a personalized home page \\nof products which are likely to be interested by them.  So, this is one of the good \\nexamples of OLAP systems. It creates a single platform for all type of business \\nanalytical means which includes planning budgeting forecasting and analysis the \\nmain benefit of OLAP is the consistency of information and calculations using \\nOLAP systems we can easily apply security restrictions on users and objects to \\ncomply with regulations and protect sensitive data. \\nOLAP assists managers in making decisions by giving multidimensional record \\nviews that are efficient to provide, hence enhancing their productivity. Due to the \\ninherent flexibility support provided by organized databases, OLAP functions \\nare self-contained. Through extensive control of analysis-capabilities, it permits \\nsimulation of business models and challenges.         \\nLet’s see the need to use OLAP to have better understanding of OLAP over \\nrelational databases:\\n1)\\n Efficient \\nand Effective methods to improve the sales of an Organization: \\nIn retail, having multiple products with different number of channels for \\nselling the product across the globe.

The data analysis power of OLAP \\nbrings  effective \\nresults in sales. It helps in identifying expenditures which \\nproduce a  high return of investments (ROI).\\nUsually, data operations and analysis are performed using the simple spreadsheet, \\nwhere data values are arranged in row and column format. This is ideal for two-\\ndimensional data. However, OLAP contains multidimensional data, with data \\nusually obtained from a different and unrelated source. Using a spreadsheet is \\nnot an optimal option. The cube can store and analyze multidimensional data in a \\nlogical and orderly manner.\\n5.3 CHARACTER ISITCS OF OLAP\\nThe main characteristics of OLAP are as follows:\\n•\\t Fast: OLAP act as bridge between Data Warehouse and front-end. Hence \\nhelps in the better accessibility of data yielding faster results.\\n•\\t Analysis: OLAP data analysis and computational measure and their results \\nare stored in separate data files. OLAP distinguishes better zero and missing \\nvalues. It should ignore missing value and performs the correct aggregate \\nvalues. OLAP facilitates interactive query handling and complex analysis \\nfor the users.\\n•\\t Shared: OLAP operations drill-down or roll-up, it navigates between \\nvarious dimensions in multidimensional cube making it effective and \\nefficient reporting system.\\n•\\t Multidimensional: OLAP has Multidimensional conceptual view and \\naccess of data to different users at different levels. The increasing number \\nof dimensions and report generation performance of the OLAP system does \\nnot significantly degrade.\\n•\\t Data and Information: OLAP has calculation power for complex queries \\nand data. It does data visualization using graphs and charts.\\n5.4  OLAP AND MULTIDIMENSION AL ANALYSIS\\nThe multi-dimensional data model stores data in the form of data cube. In a data \\nwarehouse. Generally, it supports two- or three-dimension cubes. It gives the data \\ndifferent views and perspectives. Practically in retail store the data is maintained \\nmonth wise, item wise, region wise thus involving many different dimensions.\\n5.4.1 Multidimensional Logical Data Modelin g and its Users\\nThe multidimensional data modeling provides: \\n•\\t Different\\n\\tviews\\n\\tand\\n\\tperspectives\\n\\tto\\n\\tthe\\n\\tdata\\tfrom\\n\\tdifferent\\n\\tangles.\\n\\tThe\\n\\t\\nbusiness users have a dime\\nnsional and logical view of the data in the data \\nwarehouse.\\n•\\t Multidimensional\\n\\tconceptual\\n\\tview:\\n\\tIt\\n\\tallows\\n\\tusers\\n\\tto\\n\\thave\\n\\ta\\n\\tdimensional\\n\\t\\nand logical view of the data.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2023-08-03T16:08:03+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-03T16:08:53+05:30', 'source': 'data.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content=\"74\\nEtl , O l AP and t rends\\n•\\t Multidimensional \\tmodeling \\tcreates \\tenvironment \\tfor \\tmultiuser. \\tSince \\tthe \\t\\nOLAP \\ntechniques are shared, the OLAP and database operations, containing \\nretrieval, update, adequacy control, integrity, and security can be easily \\nperformed.\\n For example, \\nin the Figure 1, it is shown that the dimensions Time, Regions \\nand Products of a company can be logically saved in a cube. In Figure 2, \\nin the cross tabular form in every quarter, products quantity are shown. In \\nFigure 1, Products, Time and Regions these dimensions can be combined \\ninto cubes you can imagine what two dimensions would look like by using \\na spreadsheet metaphor with the time dimension as the columns and the \\nproducts dimension as the rows if we add data to this view such as units sold \\nthat would be a measure.

The manager of a store house makes very different decisions to generate a \\nreport with just one or two dimensions or by adding more dimensions and reveal more \\ndetail which would allow to make better decisions on managing the inventory of the \\nstores. Hence, you can view OLAP facilitates Business Oriented multidimensional \\ndata having lot of calculations. The data saved in multidimensional structure is very \\nsignificant in speed thought analysis to companies to take better decisions.  OLAP \\nprovides the flexibility of data retrieval to generate reports. \\n5.4.2 Multidimensional Structure\\nIn the multidimensional model, data are organized into multiple dimensions, \\nand each dimension contains multiple levels of abstraction defined by concept \\nhierarchies. This organization provides users with the flexibility to view data from \\ndifferent perspectives. The data has been organized into multiple dimensions and at \\neach level of dimension, contains multiple levels of abstraction defining the concept \\nhierarchy. It provides flexibility to view data from different angles. Likewise, as \\nexplained earlier the conceptual hierarchy of a product is:\\nDepartment\\n\\t\\n→\\n\\t\\nCategory\\n\\t\\n→\\n\\t\\nSubcategory→\\n\\t\\nBrand→\\n\\t\\nProduct\\nIt is important to identify the hierarchy from multi-dimensional cube in terms of \\nquery. Then we must look at the performance measure or on which attribute or \\ndimension the query is focused on. \\n5.4.3 Multidimensional Operations\\nOLAP provides a user-friendly environment for interactive data analysis. A number \\nof OLAP data cube operations exist to materialize different views of data, allowing \\ninteractive querying and analysis of the data.\\nThe most popular end user operations on dimensional data are:\\n1)\\n \\nRoll-up\\n2)\\n \\nDrill-down\\n3)\\n Slice and Dice\\n4)\\n Pivot (rotate) \\nIn daily life we come across operations where the manager is interested in knowing the \\naggregate of data from the concept hierarchy. It can use the concept hierarchy to roll the \\ndata up so for instance instead of a daily aggregated data we have monthly aggregate \\ndata and quarterly and then annual year. The concept hierarchy of Time dimension be: \\nConcept hierarchy of Time dimension\\nYear\\nQuarter\\nMonth\\nWeek\\nDaily\\nSo, to perform this operation, we can roll-up  and store the result.

For this OLAP operation drill \\ndown can be performed. \\n1)\\n \\nRoll-up: \\nThe roll-up operation (also called drill-up or aggregation operation) performs \\naggregation on a data cube, either by climbing up a concept hierarchy for a \\ndimension or by climbing down a concept hierarchy, i.e. dimension reduction. \\nIn the following example given at figure 3, it is shown a multidimensional cube \\ncontaining the products of a Home appliances home appliances like laptop, \\nfurniture, mobile and kitchen appliances. If the manager wants to view the sales of \\nall the products quarterly, the Roll-up operation can be performed on the categories. \\nIn this aggregation process, data is category hierarchy moves up from mobile to the \\nKitchen store. In the roll-up process at least one or more dimensions get reduced \\nlike category here.\\n \\nFigure 3: Roll-up on (Category from Home Appliances and Electronics)\\nIt is also known as consolidation. This operation summarizes the data along the \\ndimension.\\n2)\\n \\nDrill-down: \\nThe drill down operation (also called roll-down) is the reverse of roll up. It navigates \\nfrom less detailed data to more detailed data. It can be realized by either stepping \\ndown a concept hierarchy for a dimension or introducing additional dimensions.  \\nFigure 4: Drill down from Time to Months'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2023-08-03T16:08:03+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-03T16:08:53+05:30', 'source': 'data.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='77\\nIntroduction to Online \\nAnalytical Processing\\nYou will observe in the above example given at figure 4 a multidimensional cube \\ncontaining products and time.

It is a data structure designed for better \\nand faster retrieval of results from the data analysis. OLAP cubes. It has dimensions \\nwith numeric facts. The data arrangement in rows and columns in multidimensional \\nis the logical view not the physical view. \\nThe steps involved in the creation of OLAP are as follows: \\nSteps to create an OLAP\\nStep 1: Extract data from variety of sources like text, excel sheets, multimedia \\nfiles, Online Transaction Processing data in flat files.\\nStep 2: Transformation and Standardization of data: Since, the data is distributed \\nand incompatible to each other. It involves the data preprocessing or cleaning part \\nwhere the semantics of databases are changed into a standard form. \\nStep 3: Loading of data: After all the database nomenclature have been followed \\nthen the data is loaded onto the OLAP server or OLAP multidimensional cube.\\nStep 4: Building of a Cube for data analysis: \\n y Select the dimensions means set of subsets of significant attributes. \\n \\n y Select the concept hierarchies.\\n y Populate the cube with the relevant data\\n y Select the numeric attribute to apply aggregate function.\\nStep 5: Report Generation\\nThe steps to create OLAP shown in the below figure 8:\\nFigure 8 : Steps to create OLAP Cube'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2023-08-03T16:08:03+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-03T16:08:53+05:30', 'source': 'data.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='81\\nIntroduction to Online \\nAnalytical Processing\\n5.9 ADVANTAGE S OF OLAP\\nThe SQL functions like Group By, Aggregating functions are quite complex to \\noperate in relational databases as compared to multidimensional databases. OLAP \\ncan pre-compute the queries can save in sub cubes. The hypercubes also make the \\ncomputation task faster and saves time. OLAP has proved to an extremely scalable \\nand user – friendly method which is able to perfectly cater to its entire customer \\nneeds ranging from small to large companies. \\nSome listed benefits of using OLAP are as follows:\\n•\\t Data\\n\\t\\nProcessing\\n\\t\\nat\\n\\t\\na\\n\\t\\nfaster\\n\\t\\nspeed\\nThe speed of query execution has been tremendous since the use of OLAP \\ntechnology and is now counted as one of the primary benefits for it. This prevents \\nthe customers from spending a lot of time and money on heavy calculations and \\ncreating complex reports.\\n•\\t Accessibility\\nThe cube enables the various kinds of data like – transactional data from various \\nresources, information about every supplier and consumer, etc. all is saved in a \\nconcise one location which is easy to operate. \\n•\\t Concise\\n\\t\\nand\\n\\t\\nFine\\n\\t\\nData\\nOLAP works on the principle of combining multiple and similar records together, \\nwhich are saved in multiple tables forming a schema between them as a source of \\nconnection. Theses tables combine to form the cube to make the massive information \\nconcise and yet finely available to the user. Records can be elemental right down \\nto a single element by “drill down” and back to the cube by “drill up” operations.\\n•\\t Data\\n\\t\\nRepresentation\\n\\t\\nin\\n\\t\\nMulti-Dimension\\nOLAP cube is the center of all the data. Each element of the cube contains various \\nattributes and the number of processes performed on it. The cube axes are outlined \\nby the measure and dimension of the cube which is mostly three - dimensional \\nsystem. This allows the user to take the information from various slices of the cube. \\nA cube slice is a two – dimensional in nature which gives a clear image of the \\nknowledge trying to be represented.\\n•\\t Business\\n\\t\\nExpressions\\n\\t\\ncommonly\\n\\t\\nused\\nThe size of an OLAP cube consisting of data portrays the company’s economic and \\nfinancial conditions. The end user does not manipulate the database files; they deal \\nwith end processes like products, salesmen, employees, customers, etc. This gives a \\nreason to even user with less to zero technical background to use LAP technology.\\n•\\t Situational\\n\\t\\nScenarios\\nThe way the cube can cover almost all parts of a data item is through creating \\nvarious what – if situations; these what – if situations help in extraction of cube \\ninformation without tampering the original information on the cube. This feature of \\nOLAP technology is responsible for providing the customers the ability to update \\nthe values to look at the consequences brought in the cube’s situation. Through this \\nfeature business intelligence can deeply examine the possible factors of driving a \\nsituation in a company and prevent them if necessary.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2023-08-03T16:08:03+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-03T16:08:53+05:30', 'source': 'data.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='82\\nEtl , O l AP and t rends\\n•\\t Easily \\tUnderstood\\tTechnology\\nMost of \\nthe users or customers working on OLAP technology come from a \\nbackground of less to minimum technology skills.

Moreover, OLAP technology providers provide their end users with \\nenough tutorial, documents and some start off technical assistance particularly in \\ncase of web – based OLAP operations. The end customers are given sessions to \\ncontinuously work with a group of technical experts so that they do not have to \\nsolve all the OLAP issues by themselves.\\n5.10  OLAP ARCHITECTURE: MOLAP, ROLAP, HOLAP \\nAND DOLAP\\nThere are types of OLAP architecture: ROLAP, MOLAP, HOLAP and others as \\nshown in the below figure 9. \\nFigure 9: Types of OLAP Architecture\\nROLAP Architecture\\nROLAP implies Relational OLAP, an application based on relational DBMSs.
